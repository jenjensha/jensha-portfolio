It inspired me to reboot my career and I came across Restart Network. Restart Network triggered my interest in learning how to develop websites as I have been curious in the past about the fast changing world of Technology. In the future, It would be an honour for me to use my coding skills in a community of passionate people who are focussed on helping others."
