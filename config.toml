After a while I came across Restart Network and I thought this program will definitely help me widen my knowledge about coding.Restart Network helped and guided me to learn more about what it means to be a developer. Since then I am passionate and working hard to achieve my ambition to become a developer. What I like most about coding is that it gives me happiness whenever I solve problems and challenges. This gives me a sense of achievement, and that inspires me to learn more everyday.In the future, It would be an honour for me to use my coding skills in a community of passionate people who are focussed on helping others."
