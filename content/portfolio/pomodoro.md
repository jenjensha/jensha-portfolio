### Pomodoro Clock

To begin our new phase as a student in Restart Network we started to create our own Pomodoro Clock using Jquery and Bootstrap.The Pomodoro Clock uses a timer to break down work into intervals of 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks. The method is based on the idea that frequent breaks can improve mental agility.
