### Javascript Calculator

To start our new journey in Restart Network after finishing 3 months bootcamp in learning LAMP Stack development. We continued to learn in depth about Javascript.

Also, it can keep chaining mathematical operations together till equal button is click, and the calculator will show the correct output.
