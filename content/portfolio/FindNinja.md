### MERN Project


#### Description

As part of Mern Stack development tutorial during my Restart Network guide period I followed and created this application that will allow user to locate a ninja using Geo Near Locator.

#### How To Use
Please enter latitude 25 and enter longitude -80 to find close by ninjas.

#### Technologies Used
Node.js<br/>
Basic React<br/>
MongoDb<br/>
Geo Near location

#### Challenges Faced

First application with React<br/>
Using Geo Near was difficult because it was outdated in the tutorial then I have to find a solution to make it work.<br/>
Deploying to google cloud
